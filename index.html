      <header><h1>So a Funny Thing Happened...</h1></header>
      <p>A pagan priest, a Catholic witch, and an atheist all walk into a bar. The only joke here is that it's not set up for a punchline.</p>

      <h2>My Grandfather, the <em>Santero</em></h2>
      <object width="640" height="480" data="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gyUSw5mhQPNQUVzhc9eH6ZDiUCcrW0Hx/preview"></object>
         <p>It's hard to imagine my grandfather as anything other than a deeply jovial man. He was the kind of person who woke up at 5am and walked miles to the mall, greeting every passerby on the street. He was the kind of man who randomly started dancing in the kitchen when browning the seasonings for <em>pernil</em>. There didn't seem to be a single thing that could dash his spirit.</p>
         <p>Maybe it was because on the mornings when he woke at 5am, he swore by washing his face in freshly fallen snow, or fanning himself for five minutes exactly. Maybe it was because as he danced, he tapped out the same rhythm he used when he took a mermaid statue into the backyard and blessed it in the name of Yemaya, she who watches over the seas. Maybe it's something that all adherents of <em>Santeri&#769a</em> who followed my grandfather's orisha, Shango, the God of thunder, fire, and, in some stories, womanizing. He might have been as jovial even if all of these things weren't true, but they were, so it's really impossible to tell.</p>
         <p>Here's the thing about <em>Santeri&#769a</em>. It isn't just about worshipping the orishas, as my gradfather did so ardently. That's the piece that was brought from Yorubaland (now Nigeria and Benin) during the African slave trade, and those pieces only survive because the slaves had to hide them under the facades of Catholic saints. Lord Shango was hidden behind brave <em>Santa Barbara</em> and Yemaya was hidden behind the chaste facade of the Virgin.</p>
         <p>My grandfather believed in the Saints as well; he believed that you spoke to the ancestors and they would speak with the orishas and the orishas would speak to Jesus Christ and all the way up the chain until God. When it came time for my mother to take Yemaya as her God, though, she prayed to the mermaid statue far less than she prayed to the cross.</p>
      <h2>My Mother, the Catholic Witch</h2>
      <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/778888248637259787/1122955078337298482/20190611_155044.jpg" width="680" height="480" alt="A photograph of my mother's altar to Yemaya. It has a pale mermaid statue with seashells laid in the palm of her hand and on the statue's base. There are two blue candles, sage for burning, incense, and gems."/>
         <p>She still has cowrie shells (for cowrie shells are how you can tell the future) and she still lights candles. But she's turned more to crystals and stones; spellbooks written by white women and vague mixtures of Eastern religions sort of thrown in. Her books of witchcraft line the shelves, speaking of good and bad magic, white and black magic, and yet there is none referencing our island ancestery.We were supposed to get my grandfather's books after he died. Unfortunately, due to a break into a dead man's apartment, we never were able to get them. That particular story, though, would be for another time.</p>
         <p>She calls herself a white witch. But I didn't even know my mother was a witch until I was 16. She didn't have the spellbooks or the candles at first; she raised us with Bible stories and Sunday church masses. Then when I was 16, I had an out of body experience.</p>
         <h2>Myself, an Atheist</h2>
         <p>It's much funnier in hindsight than it was at the moment. How many people can say they felt something distorted dig its claws into their flesh and try to tear them out, only to get disgusted last minute and slam them back in? Bit of a blow to the ego, to be honest. Like, am I not good enough to steal the soul of? My mother's response of "Oh yeah, every firstborn in our family has an out of body experience when they're 16, don't worry about it." did not actually help as much as one might expect.</p>
         <p>I know now that it was likely just sleep paralysis. The fact that my mother felt that same sleep paralysis at age 16 and had a vision of meeting her grandfather (Enrique Gonzales Martinez- my grandfather drilled the name into me for weeks before his own death, telling stories about a baker with a missing hand who was "the blackest man you could see") and recieved advice is a strange coincidence. The fact that my grandfather dreamt of his father's death the night before it happened has no bearing on the fact that I dreamt my grandfather's death two months before it happened.</p>
         <p>Before my grandfather died, he told me I had a power within me to speak with the dead. If my dreams were in any way prophetic, then the ancestors and my angels were close at hand; all I would need is a candle, a cup of water, and the last words he ever spoke to me.</p>
         <p>(The joke goes that the priest and the witch ask the atheist whether he'd like some spirits. The atheist says, "No, thanks," and vacates the bar.)</p>
